# VolumeMediaControl

Volume Media Control allows you to control the media volume instead of ringer volume when you press the volume buttons.

This app aims to fix an annoying issue with Android where volume controls act differently depending on if media is being played or not. 
For example, when you are using Netflix, the volume control should  adjust media volume and not the ringer volume.

Volume Media Control makes use of accessibility service to control volume button behaviour
